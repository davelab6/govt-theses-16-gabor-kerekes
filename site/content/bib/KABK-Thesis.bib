  abstract = {Computer software or simply software is any set of instructions that directs a computer to perform specific operations. Computer software consists of computer programs, libraries and related non-executable data (such as online documentation or digital media). Computer software is non-tangible, contrasted with computer hardware, which is the physical component of computers. Computer hardware and software require each other and neither can be realistically used without the other.
At the lowest level, executable code consists of machine language instructions specific to an individual processor—typically a central processing unit (CPU). A machine language consists of groups of binary values signifying processor instructions that change the state of the computer from its preceding state. For example, an instruction may change the value stored in a particular storage location inside the computer—an effect that is not directly observable to the user. An instruction may also (indirectly) cause something to appear on a display of the computer system—a state change which should be visible to the user. The processor carries out the instructions in the order they are provided, unless it is instructed to "jump" to a different instruction, or interrupted.
Software written in a machine language is known as "machine code". However, in practice, software is usually written in high-level programming languages that are easier and more efficient for humans to use (closer to natural language) than machine language. High-level languages are translated into machine language using a compiler or an interpreter or a combination of the two. Software may also be written in a low-level assembly language, essentially, a vaguely mnemonic representation of a machine language using a natural language alphabet. Assembly language is translated into machine language using an assembler.},

  abstract = {Machine code or machine language is a set of instructions executed directly by a computer's central processing unit (CPU). Each instruction performs a very specific task, such as a load, a jump, or an ALU operation on a unit of data in a CPU register or memory. Every program directly executed by a CPU is made up of a series of such instructions.
Numerical machine code (i.e., not assembly code) may be regarded as the lowest-level representation of a compiled or assembled computer program or as a primitive and hardware-dependent programming language. While it is possible to write programs directly in numerical machine code, it is tedious and error prone to manage individual bits and calculate numerical addresses and constants manually. It is thus rarely done today, except for situations that require extreme optimization or debugging.
Almost all practical programs today are written in higher-level languages or assembly language and translated to executable machine code by utilities such as compilers, assemblers and linkers. Programs in interpreted languages are not translated into machine code although their interpreter (which may be seen as an executor or processor) typically consists of directly executable machine code (generated from assembly or high level language source code).},

Data as a general concept refers to the fact that some existing information or knowledge is represented or coded in some form suitable for better usage or processing.
Raw data, i.e. unprocessed data, is a collection of numbers, characters; data processing commonly occurs by stages, and the "processed data" from one stage may be considered the "raw data" of the next. Field data is raw data that is collected in an uncontrolled in situ environment. Experimental data is data that is generated within the context of a scientific investigation by observation and recording.
The word "data" originated as the plural of "datum", and still may be used as a plural noun in this sense. Nowadays, though, "data" is most commonly used in the singular, as a mass noun (like "information", "sand" or "rain").},

  abstract = {Technological determinism is a reductionist theory that presumes that a society's technology drives the development of its social structure and cultural values. The term is believed to have been coined by Thorstein Veblen (1857–1929), an American sociologist and economist. The most radical technological determinist in the United States in the 20th century was most likely Clarence Ayres who was a follower of Thorstein Veblen and John Dewey. William Ogburn was also known for his radical technological determinism.
The first major elaboration of a technological determinist view of socioeconomic development came from the German philosopher and economist Karl Marx, whose theoretical framework was grounded in the perspective that changes in technology, and specifically productive technology, are the primary influence on human social relations and organizational structure, and that social relations and cultural practices ultimately revolve around the technological and economic base of a given society. Marx's position has become embedded in contemporary society, where the idea that fast-changing technologies alter human lives is all-pervasive. Although many authors attribute a technologically determined view of human history to Marx's insights, not all Marxists are technological determinists, and some authors question the extent to which Marx himself was a determinist. Furthermore, there are multiple forms of technological determinism.},

  abstract = {Jacobitism (/ˈdʒækəbaɪˌtɪzm/ JAK-ə-beye-TIZ-əm; Irish: Seacaibíteachas, Scottish Gaelic: Seumasachas) was a political movement in Great Britain and Ireland that aimed to restore the Roman Catholic Stuart King James II of England and his heirs to the thrones of England, Scotland and Ireland. The movement took its name from Jacobus, the Renaissance Latin form of Iacomus, the original Latin form of James. Adherents rebelled against the British government on several occasions between 1688 and 1746.
After James II was deposed in 1688 and replaced by his daughter Mary II, ruling jointly with her husband and first cousin (James's nephew) William III, the Stuarts lived in exile, occasionally attempting to regain the throne. The strongholds of Jacobitism were parts of the Scottish Highlands and the lowland north-east of Scotland, Ireland, and parts of Northern England (mostly within the counties of Northumberland and Lancashire). Significant support also existed in Wales and South-West England.
The Jacobites believed that parliamentary interference with the line of succession to the English and Scottish thrones was illegal. Catholics also hoped the Stuarts would end recusancy. In Scotland, the Jacobite cause became intertwined with the last throes of the warrior clan system.
The emblem of the Jacobites is the White Cockade. White Rose Day is celebrated on 10 June, the anniversary of the birth of the Old Pretender in 1688.},

It is commonly known as TCP/IP, because its most important protocols, the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and the Internet Protocol (IP) were the first networking protocols defined in this standard. It is occasionally known as the DoD model, because the development of the networking model was funded by DARPA, an agency of the United States Department of Defense.
TCP/IP provides end-to-end connectivity specifying how data should be packetized, addressed, transmitted, routed and received at the destination. This functionality is organized into four abstraction layers which are used to sort all related protocols according to the scope of networking involved. From lowest to highest, the layers are the link layer, containing communication methods for data that remains within a single network segment (link); the internet layer, connecting independent networks, thus establishing internetworking; the transport layer handling host-to-host communication; and the application layer, which provides process-to-process data exchange for application.
The TCP/IP model and many of its protocols are maintained by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).},

  abstract = {Studies on malaria and on A. b. balabacensis and A. minimus responses to DDT spraying were conducted in a forested hilly area in northern Thailand. In a first phase, base-line data were collected from July 1970 to March 1972. In a second phase, the study area received five round of DDT spraying over a period of two years and at the same time all malaria infections received radical treatment. During this two-year period of field operations, entomological and epidemiological observations were continued. The studies carried out in the second phase, showed that malaria transmission decreased under the applied optimum anti-malarial measures but was not interrupted. Human ecology and population movement inside the forest, especially during the dry season, contributed to a great extent to this result. The transmission occurring in the early part of the monsoon season clearly indicates the importance of the timing of DDT spraying. A. b. balabacensis appeared to be transmitting malaria all the year round in the deep forest but only in the monsoon season in the forest fringe. The vectorial capacity of both vectors was estimated separately for indoor and outdoor populations. The pre-spraying values obtained for A. b. balabacensis were much higher thaan for A. minimus. After DDT spraying A. b. balabacensis showed a decrease in vectorial capacity estimated at 31.5 times for the indoor population and 18 times for the outdoor population. A. minimus, on the other hand, showed a much smaller decrease, estimated at 6.8 and 1.9 times for the indoor and outdoor populations respectively.},

  abstract = {Yahoo! GeoCities (also known as GeoCities) is a web hosting service, currently available only in Japan. It was founded in 1994 by David Bohnett and John Rezner, and was called Beverly Hills Internet (BHI) for a very short time. In 1999 GeoCities was acquired by Yahoo!; at that time it was the third-most visited website on the World Wide Web. In its original form, site users selected a "city" in which to place their web pages. The "cities" were named after real cities or regions according to their content—for example, computer-related sites were placed in "SiliconValley" and those dealing with entertainment were assigned to "Hollywood"—hence the name of the site. Shortly after its acquisition by Yahoo!, this practice was abandoned in favor of using the Yahoo! member names in the URLs.
In April 2009, approximately ten years after Yahoo! bought GeoCities, the company announced that it would shut down the United States GeoCities service on October 26, 2009. There were at least 38 million user-built pages on GeoCities before it was shut down. The GeoCities Japan version of the service is still available.

  url = {https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Interrupt&oldid=691896690},
  abstract = {In system programming, an interrupt is a signal to the processor emitted by hardware or software indicating an event that needs immediate attention. An interrupt alerts the processor to a high-priority condition requiring the interruption of the current code the processor is executing. The processor responds by suspending its current activities, saving its state, and executing a function called an interrupt handler (or an interrupt service routine, ISR) to deal with the event. This interruption is temporary, and, after the interrupt handler finishes, the processor resumes normal activities. There are two types of interrupts: hardware interrupts and software interrupts.
Hardware interrupts are used by devices to communicate that they require attention from the operating system. Internally, hardware interrupts are implemented using electronic alerting signals that are sent to the processor from an external device, which is either a part of the computer itself, such as a disk controller, or an external peripheral. For example, pressing a key on the keyboard or moving the mouse triggers hardware interrupts that cause the processor to read the keystroke or mouse position. Unlike the software type (described below), hardware interrupts are asynchronous and can occur in the middle of instruction execution, requiring additional care in programming. The act of initiating a hardware interrupt is referred to as an interrupt request (IRQ).
A software interrupt is caused either by an exceptional condition in the processor itself, or a special instruction in the instruction set which causes an interrupt when it is executed. The former is often called a trap or exception and is used for errors or events occurring during program execution that are exceptional enough that they cannot be handled within the program itself. For example, if the processor's arithmetic logic unit is commanded to divide a number by zero, this impossible demand will cause a divide-by-zero exception, perhaps causing the computer to abandon the calculation or display an error message. Software interrupt instructions function similarly to subroutine calls and are used for a variety of purposes, such as to request services from low-level system software such as device drivers. For example, computers often use software interrupt instructions to communicate with the disk controller to request data be read or written to the disk.
Each interrupt has its own interrupt handler. The number of hardware interrupts is limited by the number of interrupt request (IRQ) lines to the processor, but there may be hundreds of different software interrupts. Interrupts are a commonly used technique for computer multitasking, especially in real-time computing. Such a system is said to be interrupt-driven.},

  abstract = {In computer systems programming, an interrupt handler, also known as an interrupt service routine or ISR, is a callback function in microcontroller firmware, an operating system or a device driver, whose execution is triggered by the reception of an interrupt. In general, interrupts and their handlers are used to handle high-priority conditions that require the interruption of the current code the processor is executing.
Interrupt handlers have a multitude of functions, which vary based on the reason the interrupt was generated and the speed at which the interrupt handler completes its task. For example, pressing a key on a computer keyboard, or moving the mouse, triggers interrupts that call interrupt handlers which read the key, or the mouse's position, and copy the associated information into the computer's memory.
An interrupt handler is a low-level counterpart of event handlers. These handlers are initiated by either hardware interrupts or interrupt instructions in software, and are used for servicing hardware devices and transitions between protected modes of operation such as system calls.},

  abstract = {In computer science, the event loop, message dispatcher, message loop, message pump, or run loop is a programming construct that waits for and dispatches events or messages in a program. It works by making a request to some internal or external "event provider" (which generally blocks the request until an event has arrived), and then it calls the relevant event handler ("dispatches the event"). The event-loop may be used in conjunction with a reactor, if the event provider follows the file interface, which can be selected or 'polled' (the Unix system call, not actual polling). The event loop almost always operates asynchronously with the message originator.
When the event loop forms the central control flow construct of a program, as it often does, it may be termed the main loop or main event loop. This title is appropriate because such an event loop is at the highest level of control within the program.},

  abstract = {The reaction of glutamate dehydrogenase and glutamate (gl) with NAD+ and NADP+ has been studied with stopped-flow techniques. The enzyme was in all experiments present in excess of the coenzyme. The results indicate that the ternary complex (E-NAD(P)H-kg) is present as an intermediate in the formation of the stable complex (E-NAD(P)H-gl). The identification of the complexes is based on their absorption spectra. The binding of the coenzyme to (E-gl) is the rate-limiting step in the formation of (E-NAD(P)H-kg) while the dissociation of alpha-ketoglutarate (kg) from this complex is the rate-limiting step in the formation of (E-NAD(P)H-gl). The Km for glutamate was 20-25 mM in the first reaction and 3 mM in the formation of the stable complex. The Km values were independent of the coenzyme. The reaction rates with NAD+ were approximately 50\% greater than those with NADP+. Furthermore, high glutamate concentration inhibited the formation of (E-NADH-kg) while no substrate inhibition was found with NADP+ as coenzyme. ADP enhanced while GTP reduced the rate of (E-NAD(P)H-gl) formation. The rate of formation of (E-NAD(P)H-kg) was inhibited by ADP, while it increased at high glutamate concentration when small amounts of GTP were added. The results show that the higher activity found with NAD+ compared to NADP+ under steady-state assay conditions do not necessarily involve binding of NAD+ to the ADP activating site of the enzyme. Moreover, the substrate inhibition found at high glutamate concentration under steady-state assay condition is not due to the formation of (E-NAD(P)H-gl) as this complex is formed with Km of 3 mM glutamate, and the substrate inhibition is only significant at 20-30 times this concentration.},

  volume = {154},
  issn = {0264-6021},
  abstract = {1. The activities of citrate synthase, NAD+-linked and NADP+-linked isocitrate dehydrogenase were measured in muscles from a large number of animals, in order to provide some indication of the importance of the citric acid cycle in these muscles. According to the differences in enzyme activities, the muscles can be divided into three classes. First, in a number of both vertebrate and invertebrate muscles, the activities of all three enzymes are very low. It is suggested that either the muscles use energy at a very low rate or they rely largely on anaerobic glycolysis for higher rates of energy formation. Second, most insect flight muscles contain high activities of citrate synthase and NAD+-linked isocitrate dehydrogenase, but the activities of the NADP+-linked enzyme are very low. The high activities indicate the dependence of insect flight on energy generated via the citric acid cycle. The flight muscles of the beetles investigated contain high activities of both isocitrate dehydrogenases. Third, other muscles of both vertebrates and invertebrates contain high activities of citrate synthase and NADP+-liniked isocitrate dehydrogenase. Many, if not all, of these muscles are capable of sustained periods of mechanical activity (e.g. heart muscle, pectoral muscles of some birds). Consequently, to support this activity fuel must be supplied continually to the muscle via the circulatory system which, in most animals, also transports oxygen so that energy can be generated by complete oxidation of the fuel. It is suggested that the low activities of NAD+-linked isocitrate dehydrogenase in these muscles may be involved in oxidation of isocitrate in the cycle when the muscles are at rest. 2. A comparison of the maximal activities of the enzymes with the maximal flux through the cycle suggests that, in insect flight muscle, NAD+-linked isocitrate dehydrogenase catalyses a non-equilibrium reaction and citrate synthease catalyses a near-equilibrium reaction. In other muscles, the enzyme-activity data suggest that both citrate synthase and the isocitrate dehydrogenase reactions are near-equilibrium.},

Switch statements exist in most high-level imperative programming languages such as Pascal, Ada, C/C++, C\# and Java, and in many other types of language, using such keywords as switch, case, select or inspect.
Switch statements come in two main variants: a structured switch, as in Pascal, which takes exactly one branch, and an unstructured switch, as in C, which functions as a type of goto. The main reasons for using a switch include improving clarity, by reducing otherwise repetitive coding, and (if the heuristics permit) also offering the potential for faster execution through easier compiler optimization in many cases.},

The actual act of reading literary texts is seen as part of a wider process of human development and growth based on understanding both one's own experience and the social world. Learning to read must be seen as one aspect of the act of knowing and as a creative act.

  abstract = {In sociology, industrial society refers to a society driven by the use of technology to enable mass production, supporting a large population with a high capacity for division of labour. Such a structure developed in the west in the period of time following the Industrial Revolution, and replaced the agrarian societies of the Pre-modern, Pre-industrial age. Industrial societies are generally mass societies, and may be succeeded by an Information society. They are often contrasted to with the traditional societies.
Industrial society is characterized by the use of external energy sources, such as fossil fuels, to increase the rate and scale of production. The production of food is shifted to large commercial farms where the products of industry, such as combine harvesters and fossil fuel based fertilizers, are used to decrease required human labor while increasing production. No longer needed for the production of food, excess labor is moved into these factories where mechanization is utilized to further increase efficiency. As populations grow, and mechanization is further refined, often to the level of automation, many workers shift to expanding service industries.
Industrial society makes urbanization desirable, in part so that workers can be closer to centers of production, and the service industry can provide labor to workers and those that benefit financially from them, in exchange for a piece of production profits with which they can buy goods. This leads to the rise of very large cities and surrounding suburban areas with a high rate of economic activity.
These urban centers require the input of external energy sources in order to overcome the diminishing returns of agricultural consolidation, due partially to the lack of nearby arable land, associated transportation and storage costs, and are otherwise unsustainable. This makes the reliable availability of the needed energy resources high priority in industrial government policies.
Some theoreticians—namely Ulrich Beck, Anthony Giddens and Manuel Castells—argue that we are located in the middle of a transformation or transition from industrial societies to post-modern societies. The triggering technology for the change from an agricultural to an industrial organisation was steam power, allowing mass production and reducing the agricultural work necessary. Thus many industrial cities are built around rivers. Identified as catalyst or trigger for the transition to post-modern or informational society is global information technology.},

  abstract = {In computer science, a call stack is a stack data structure that stores information about the active subroutines of a computer program. This kind of stack is also known as an execution stack, control stack, run-time stack, or machine stack, and is often shortened to just "the stack". Although maintenance of the call stack is important for the proper functioning of most software, the details are normally hidden and automatic in high-level programming languages. Many computer instruction sets provide special instructions for manipulating stacks.
A call stack is used for several related purposes, but the main reason for having one is to keep track of the point to which each active subroutine should return control when it finishes executing. An active subroutine is one that has been called but is yet to complete execution after which control should be handed back to the point of call. Such activations of subroutines may be nested to any level (recursive as a special case), hence the stack structure. If, for example, a subroutine DrawSquare calls a subroutine DrawLine from four different places, DrawLine must know where to return when its execution completes. To accomplish this, the address following the call instruction, the return address, is pushed onto the call stack with each call.},

  abstract = {In computer science, a stack is an abstract data type that serves as a collection of elements, with two principal operations: push, which adds an element to the collection, and pop, which removes the most recently added element that was not yet removed. The order in which elements come off a stack gives rise to its alternative name, LIFO (for last in, first out). Additionally, a peek operation may give access to the top without modifying the stack.
The name "stack" for this type of structure comes from the analogy to a set of physical items stacked on top of each other, which makes it easy to take an item of the top of the stack, while getting to an item deeper in the stack may require taking off multiple other items first.
Considered as a linear data structure, or more abstractly a sequential collection, the push and pop operations occur only at one end of the structure, referred to as the top of the stack. This makes it possible to implement a stack as a singly linked list and a pointer to the top element.
A stack may be implemented to have a bounded capacity. If the stack is full and does not contain enough space to accept an entity to be pushed, the stack is then considered to be in an overflow state. The pop operation removes an item from the top of the stack.},

  edition = {Spring 2016},
  title = {Process {{Philosophy}}},
  url = {http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2016/entries/process-philosophy/},
  abstract = {Process philosophy is based on the premise that being is dynamic andthat the dynamic nature of being should be the primary focus of anycomprehensive philosophical account of reality and our place withinit. Even though we experience our world and ourselves as continuously changing, Western metaphysics has long been obsessed withdescribing reality as an assembly of static individuals whose dynamicfeatures are either taken to be mere appearances or ontologically secondary and derivative. For processphilosophers the adventure of philosophy begins with a set of problemsthat traditional metaphysics marginalizes or even sidestepsaltogether: what is the role of mind in our experience of realityas becoming?  Are there several varieties of becoming —for instance, the uniform going on of activities versus the comingabout of developments? Do all developments have the same way of occurring quite independently of what iscoming about?  How can we best classify into different kinds ofoccurrences what is going on and coming about? How can we understandthe emergence of apparently novel conditions? , While process philosophers insist that all within and about reality iscontinuously going on and coming about, they do not deny that thereare temporally stable and reliably recurrent aspects of reality.  Butthey take such aspects of persistence to be the regular behavior ofdynamic organizations that arise due to the continuously ongoinginteraction of processes. In order to articulate a process view ofreality, a special theoretical effort is required, however, since thestandard theoretical tools of Western metaphysics are geared to thestatic view of reality.  Especially the standard interpretation ofpredicate logic in terms of static individuals with properties thatare exemplified timelessly or at a temporal instant consolidates whatis from the process-philosophical perspective an unhelpful theoreticalbias. This has forced upon process philosophy a double role as metaphysical and metaphilosophical enterprise,taking up the double task of developing new explanatoryconcepts and providing arguments for why these conceptsbetter serve the aims of philosophy., Process philosophy has full systematic scope: its concern is with thedynamic sense of being as becoming or occurrence, the conditions ofspatio-temporal existence, the kinds of dynamic entities, therelationship between mind and world, and the realization of values inaction.  Some approaches to process philosophy are conceived on thegrand scale and offer a full-scope metaphysics in the form of asystematic theory or comprehensive philosophical view. Otherapproaches, especially more recent ones, take a more modest approach.They pursue the specific problems that the various philosophicaldisciplines are engaged in while focusing on the dynamic aspects ofeach sub-domain. Such process ontologies, process ethics, processepistemologies, process theories of mind etc. are contributions to‘process philosophy’ more broadly conceived as a researchparadigm of philosophical inquiry. They share the guiding idea thatnatural existence consists in modes of becoming and types of occurrences.  ‘Processists’agree that the world is an assembly of physical, organic, social, andcognitive processes that interact at and across levels of dynamicorganization.  However, within that broad framework, processphilosophers debate about how such a world of processes is to beconstrued, how it relates to the human mind (which is another process)and how the dynamic nature of reality relates to our scientifictheories.  In consequence, process philosophers also differ in theirview on the role of philosophy itself and in their choice oftheoretical style., Process philosophy opposes ‘substance metaphysics,’ thedominant research paradigm in the history of Western philosophy sinceAristotle.  Substance metaphysics proceeds from theintuition—first formulated by the pre-Socratic Greek philosopherParmenides—that being should be thought of as simple, hence asinternally undifferentiated and unchangeable.  Substancemetaphysicians recast this intuition as the claim that the primaryunits of reality (called “substances”) must bestatic—they must be what they are at any instant in time. Incontrast to the substance-metaphysical snapshot view of reality, withits typical focus on eternalist being and on what there is,process philosophers analyze becoming and what is occurring as well asways of occurring. In some process accounts, becomingis the mode of being common to the many kinds of occurrences ordynamic beings. Other process accounts hold that being is ongoingself-differentiation; on these accounts becoming is both the mode ofbeing of different kinds of dynamic beings and the processthat generates different kinds of dynamic beings. In order to developa taxonomy of dynamic beings (types and modes of occurrences),processists replace the descriptive concepts of substance metaphysicswith a set of new basic categories.  Central among these is the notionof a basic entity that is individuated in terms of what it‘does.’ This type of functionally individuated entity isoften labeled ‘process’ in a technical sense of this termthat does not coincide with our common-sense notion of a process. Someof the ‘processes’ postulated by process philosophersare—in agreement with our common-sense understanding ofprocesses—temporal developments that can be analyzed astemporally structured sequences of stages of an occurrence, with eachsuch stage being numerically and qualitatively different from anyother. But some of the ‘processes’ that processphilosophers operate with are not temporal developments in this sense— they are, for example, temporal but non-developmentaloccurrences like activities, or non-spatiotemporal happenings thatrealize themselves in a developmental fashion and therebyconstitute the directionality of time.  What holds for all dynamicentities labelled ‘processes’, however, is thatthey occur — that they are somehow or other intimatelyconnected not only to temporal extension but also to the directionality orpassage of time.  ,  Process philosophers claim that there are many sound philosophicalreasons to take the processual aspects of nature, cognition, andaction as fundamental features of the real.  The perhaps most powerfulargument for process philosophy is its wide descriptive or explanatoryscope. If we admit that the basic entities of our world are processes,we can generate better philosophical descriptions of all the kinds ofentities and relationships we are committed to when we reason aboutour world in common sense and in science: from quantum entanglement toconsciousness, from computation to feelings, from things toinstitutions, from organisms to societies, from traffic jams toclimate change, from spacetime to beauty. Moreover, results incognitive science, some philosophers have claimed, show that we need aprocess metaphysics in order to develop a naturalist theory of themind and of normativity. These arguments form the background for theprocessist criticism of the focus on substance in Westernphilosophy. The bias towards substances seems to be rooted partly inthe cognitive dispositions of speakers of Indo-European languages, andpartly in theoretical habituation, as the traditional prioritizationof static entities (substances, objects, states of affairs, staticstructures) at the beginning of Western metaphysics built onitself. In contrast, process philosophy shows fewer affinities to anyparticular language group and can allude to a rich tradition ofreflection in many of the great schools of Eastern thought.  Thuscontemporary process philosophy not only holds out the promise of anintegrated metaphysics that can join our common sense and scientificimages of the world.  It is also of interest as a platform upon whichto build an intercultural philosophy and to facilitateinterdisciplinary research on global knowledge representation by meansof an ontological framework that is no longer parochially Western.},

  abstract = {In mathematics and computer science, an algorithm (/ˈælɡərɪðəm/ AL-gə-ri-dhəm) is a self-contained step-by-step set of operations to be performed. Algorithms exist that perform calculation, data processing, and automated reasoning.
The words 'algorithm' and 'algorism' come from the name al-Khwārizmī. Al-Khwārizmī (Persian: خوارزمي‎‎, c. 780-850) was a Persian mathematician, astronomer, geographer, and scholar.
An algorithm is an effective method that can be expressed within a finite amount of space and time and in a well-defined formal language for calculating a function. Starting from an initial state and initial input (perhaps empty), the instructions describe a computation that, when executed, proceeds through a finite number of well-defined successive states, eventually producing "output" and terminating at a final ending state. The transition from one state to the next is not necessarily deterministic; some algorithms, known as randomized algorithms, incorporate random input.
The concept of algorithm has existed for centuries, however a partial formalization of what would become the modern algorithm began with attempts to solve the Entscheidungsproblem (the "decision problem") posed by David Hilbert in 1928. Subsequent formalizations were framed as attempts to define "effective calculability" or "effective method"; those formalizations included the Gödel–Herbrand–Kleene recursive functions of 1930, 1934 and 1935, Alonzo Church's lambda calculus of 1936, Emil Post's "Formulation 1" of 1936, and Alan Turing's Turing machines of 1936–7 and 1939. Giving a formal definition of algorithms, corresponding to the intuitive notion, remains a challenging problem.},
