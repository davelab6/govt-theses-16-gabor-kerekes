<h1>Information revolutions</h1>
<p><span class="information social-organization">Throughout history, forms of social organization were always tightly related to the ways in which information was produced, distributed and consumed.</span> <span class="technology disruption">Johannes Gutenberg's invention of the printing press in the 15th century had unleashed a historical process that brought with it revolutions in political and scientific thinking and eventually, a radically different social order.</span></p>
<p><span class="knowledge power literacy media distribution">Until the invention of printing, knowledge could only be reproduced through the expensive and time-consuming way of copying manuscripts by hand. Book production was the monopoly of the Catholic Church which exercised total control over the types of information that could be circulated. Furthermore, literacy was the privilege of the elite and the Church's monopoly over information secured their power over the illiterate majority.</span> The invention of printing technology had far reaching implications. By enabling the fast and cheap reproduction of information, alternative political views could now be effectively disseminated. Print provided the ground for the practice of public discourse and the distribution of knowledge. In the short term this gave way to the Protestant Reformation, on the long term, it lead to the rise of market economies, the philosophical movement of the Enlightenment, the scientific and industrial revolution and the rise of nation states.</p>
<p>How could a technical innovation induce such a far reaching process of social change? Did it create this change or did it facilitate latent social forces? According to Marshall McLuhan <em>&quot;[...]with the Gutenberg technology we move into the age of the take-off of the machine. The principle of segmentation of actions and functions and roles became systematically applicable wherever desired&quot;</em><span class="citation" data-cites="gutenberggalaxymaking_mcluhan_2011"><sup>1(p276)</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="technology distribution knowledge">Printing technology's importance did not only lie in its enabling the distribution of knowledge, it was also a protocol of segmentation and modularization.</span> The main thesis of McLuhan is that new technologies create new ways of perceiving the world, which in turn instantiate new forms of social organization. This is what McLuhan meant by the often quoted slogan &quot;The Medium is the Message&quot;. <span class="power knowledge distribution">The distribution of powers, the specialization of knowledge, the division of labor were all instances of a consciousness that the technology of printing facilitated, or in McLuhan's words: <em>&quot;Print exists by virtue of the static separation of functions and fosters a mentality that gradually resists any but a separative and compartmentalizing or specialist outlook&quot;</em><span class="citation" data-cites="gutenberggalaxymaking_mcluhan_2011"><sup>1(p126)</sup></span></span></p>
<p>Do technological innovations inevitably create new forms of societies? Do tools shape societies or do societies shape tools? McLuhan is considered to be a representative of the theory of 'technological determinism'.<span class="citation" data-cites="technologicaldeterminism_2015"><sup>2</sup></span> The basic assumption of this theory is that technological progress is the main driving force of the development of societies. The opposite of technological determinism is social determinism, which inverts this relationship and states that society is the autonomous force that shapes technology. Both are reductionist theories that try to explain the complex relationships between technology and society in terms of a simple cause-end-effect mechanism.</p>
<p>The conflict between the two opposing views could be found in a synthesis of these theories. Technologies do not exist separately from their applications. These applications are in turn determined by social forces. However technologies facilitate certain kinds of social forces, while they repress others. The relationship between society and technology is characterized by feedback loops rather then determinism; technological and social progress are driven the synergetic effects of both.</p>
