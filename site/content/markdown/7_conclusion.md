>"A text more or less decipherable, more or less legible, more or less intelligible, is offered to us as a given in an active reading of every moment. To what extent would the legibility of that context
condition the very development of our own action? Through that poetical metaphor, the task of the graphic designer clearly appears: to increase the legibility of that environment, something that will permit us to reserve our efforts for the accomplishment of our autonomous actions."

Literacy is the capacity to read and to write.
This capacity allows us both to extend our understanding of reality and to assert new realities that are better aligned with the conditions we desire. Literacy empowers us to become authors of the conditions of our existence and thus it forms the basis for our individual agency.

The question of literacy demands closer attention in  light of the accelerating technological developments we are witnessing today. Intrinsic to these developments is the invisible, immaterial artifact of software. The mechanisms by which our contemporary world operates are encoded in this peculiar type of executable text. Software has assimilated into itself previous technologies of communication, finance, logistics, mobility and it is now beginning to absorb instruments of governance.
Software is becoming the *limitless text, of which the phrases are the decors of our wandering, and of which the unfolding constitutes the very context of each person's life*.[@legibilityoftheworld_abrahama.moles_1989]

Technology is forming a megastructure that is beginning to envelope everyone and everything, framing our world with its expressive power. Yet our ability to decipher the text in which it's written is limited. Historical accounts can teach us a lesson about conditions where literacy was a privilege of an authority and where this authority monopolized the means of *"organizing the world's information"*.

The growing opaqueness of the world presents itself as a design challenge, demanding that we render it more legible. In order to achieve this, we need to learn to think with the logic of software: procedure.

Generally speaking, the discipline of graphic design has so far had a rather superficial engagement with the culture of software. Graphic designers have only relied on the graphical user interface to produce other artifacts, and in turn they have been produced by it. The interface lends itself as a powerful instrument of cultural framing, but it demands software literacy in order to be written.

Given the current state of affairs, I believe a deeper engagement with the technical and theoretical aspects of software is necessary. In order to face the challenge of deciphering the text of our contemporary world, we need to become literate in the reading and writing of software. That is not to say that all graphic designers must become programmers - just as not everyone literate in natural languages would become writers and poets. Nevertheless, acquiring elementary programming skills will help to think and reason procedurally.

Understanding software is fundamental to understanding contemporary society, and thus a prerequisite to materializing the ambition of somehow even shaping it. In order to arrive in the 21st century and meet the challenges of our age, one potential route for graphic design to take is to align itself with the discipline of computer science. Only in the spirit of multi-disciplinarity will it be possible to pioneer new frames of representation that are adequate to render the text of our contemporary world legible.
