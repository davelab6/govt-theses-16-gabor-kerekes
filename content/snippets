The notion of the designer as author is indicative of the field’s re-establishment as an autonomous discipline rather than a service, and the dissolution of the client-designer model as an organisational principle for the practice of graphic design. Contemporary graphic designers do not only develop form for the knowledge of other disciplines but they produce their own knowledge.

The notion of graphic design is being challenged on another front as well.
With networked media being society’s primary forms of communication forcing physical media into a complementary role, the focus of graphic design’s practice is shifting from designing fixed artifacts to designing dynamic systems.

Graphic design has been developing into an autonomous discipline that does not only give form to knowledge produced in other disciplines, but takes an active role in producing its own knowledge. The notion of the designer as author has gained a strong foothold in the consciousness of contemporary designers, resulting in an increasing amount of projects which are either self-initiated, with no commissioner present or where the client’s role is re-casted into that of a collaborator. In either case, graphic-design-as-service is being reconfigured into graphic-design-as-research.

This paradigm shift is enveloped and enabled by a broader social transformation - the decentralization of social organization. With a special focus on tools and technologies that have driven and continue to drive these developments, I aim to trace the historical trajectory of these changes, survey the current state of affairs and sketch out a possible future for the practice of graphic design.
