<h1>1. Introduction – The World as Text</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>One should consider the aggregate of successive environments our trajectory encounters in space-time, in a realistic world of everyday life - that scenery then constitutes the background against which the form of our action sequences and of our projects will stand out: a sort of immense, non-defined page unfolding around us. We perceive it in our field of consciousness as the frame where our actions are located, in what is beginning to be called the action landscape - a limitless text we must decipher through an effort, of which the &quot;printing types&quot; are the elements of the structure and the recognizable &quot;signs,&quot; of which the &quot;phrases&quot; are the successive decors of our wandering, and of which the unfolding constitutes the very context of each person's life, something like a reading of the world. — Abraham A. Moles<span class="citation" data-cites="legibilityoftheworld_abrahama.moles_1989"><sup><a href="#ref-legibilityoftheworld_abrahama.moles_1989">1</a></sup></span></p>

<p><span class="design-practice legibility">I conceive of graphic design as a practice of producing sites of significance and meaning through visual artifacts that serve as instruments for people to situate their actions within the world at large. As graphic designers we define the <em>non-defined page unfolding around us</em>, we make the illegible legible, the invisible visible. We place signs in space - both material and ideological -, so that this space can be navigated and pulled within our sphere of influence. We bring the unconscious into consciousness, by drawing and re-drawing the contours of what Abraham A. Moles calls the <em>action landscape</em>. We decipher the <em>limitless text of the world</em>, we reduce its infinite complexity into navigable maps by rendering its <em>&quot;signs&quot;</em> and <em>&quot;phrases&quot;</em> workable to human understanding, and by doing so, we empower both our audiences and ourselves to make sense of the material and ideological space we inhabit. We do this hoping that our project will engender meaningful thought and action and will improve upon the conditions of lived experience.</span></p>
<p><span class="reading-and-writing agency programming">I see Graphic Design as an instrument of reading and writing the world, of understanding it and changing its form. The particular outlook that guided my research is predicated upon the observation that in our contemporary society the <em>&quot;phrases of the successive decors of our wandering&quot;</em> are spelled out as programming constructs and that the <em>&quot;the background against which the form of our action sequences&quot;</em> is a &quot;<em>limitless text</em>&quot; of software. With this thesis, I aim towards and understanding of how to best position myself as graphic designer against that background.</span></p>
<p>To that end, the key question I will be trying to answer is is the following: <span class="question">How does software frame culture and how can graphic design utilize this to its own advantage?</span></p>
<p>In the first chapter, <em>Literacy and power</em> I explore historical examples of technological change in relation to concepts of literacy, legibility and power. I feel that these topics should be part of my inquiry as one of the implications of the growing proliferation of software is that the world is becoming increasingly illegible to us.</p>
<p>In <em>Designer as Agent</em> I trace back the historical origins of this notion and explore relationships between the concepts of agency, power and authorship.<br />
In <em>Software as Policy</em> I attempt to give an account of social theories of software and provide examples of how software is elevated to the status of policy, becoming an instrument of power.</p>
<p>In the chapter <em>Interfaces</em>, I will describe the mechanisms by which user interfaces produce users, and what this means for the practice of graphic design.</p>
<p>In chapter <em>The World as Process</em> I will explore ideas of process philosophy in its relation to graphic design. I look at process as a mode of expression and give reasons for why I think it is an adequate one for representing our contemporary word.</p>
<p>Finally, I will attempt to pull these rather disparate topics together and distill an itinerary for a future practice of graphic design.</p>
