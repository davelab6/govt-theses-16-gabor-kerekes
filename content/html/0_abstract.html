<h1>Abstract</h1>
<p>We live in an age of unprecedented technological development. Computation has reconfigured many fundamental aspects of society, and is continuing to disrupt traditional models of social organization.</p>
<p>At the heart of these developments is software. Software has absorbed into itself many of the past's technologies and today it is beginning to absorb modes of governance: software is taking the place of policy.</p>
<p>Software changes the way we perceive, think, and argue about the world. As the age of movable type and printing fostered a certain kind of thinking – mechanical, linear, object-centered – so does the age of the software facilitate its own specific mentalities – evolutionary, interconnected, system-oriented. These changes exert a gravitational pull on the field of design, whereby the role of designers is being re-casted into that of initiators and facilitators of dynamic systems and platforms, rather than producers of physical artifacts.</p>
<p>In what specific ways does software frame culture, and how can graphic design use this to its own advantage? The following thesis will be an attempt to answer these questions.</p>
<p>As graphic design is maturing into an autonomous discipline with its practitioners increasingly seeking social and political agency, in light of the growing entanglement of social and computing systems and the proliferation of software in all aspects of life, the discipline is challenged to develop new values, skills, and practices to firmly ground itself in midst of the technological turmoils of the 21st century.</p>
