<h2>4.1 The Network Society</h2>
<p><span class="theory social-organization paradigm network">According to sociologist Manuel Castells, the current social paradigm we inhabit is what he named <em>the Network Society</em>. In '<em>Materials for an Exploratory Theory of the Network Society</em>'<span class="citation" data-cites="materialsexploratorytheory_castells_2000"><sup><a href="#ref-materialsexploratorytheory_castells_2000">1</a></sup></span> he writes: &quot;<em>The network society is a specific form of social structure tentatively identified by empirical research as being characteristic of the Information Age</em>.&quot; By social structure he means &quot;<em>the organizational arrangements of humans in relationships of production/consumption, experience, and power, as expressed in meaningful interaction framed by culture</em>&quot; whereas by Information Age he refers to &quot;<em>a historical period in which human societies perform their activities in a technological paradigm constituted around microelectronics-based information/communication technologies, and genetic engineering</em>.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="paradigm network social-development power social-organization">In last two decades we have entered a new technological paradigm characterized by the global expansion of networked computing technologies. Castells writes that networks have been an important part of social organization since antiquity, but the power of these networks were limited by the communication technologies of their age. He goes on to argue that the ongoing revolution in our communication technologies - underpinned by the exponential increase of information processing power and the simultaneous proliferation of information networks - enabled a social development which he describes as a kind of decentralization of power relations. A shift from <em>&quot;hierarchical bureaucracies based on the vertical integration of resources and subjects as the expression of the organized power of a social elite&quot;</em> that characterized the social organization of the industrial age to the contemporary social arrangement consisting of a set of interconnected nodes where power is distributed over a multiplicity of centers.<span class="citation" data-cites="networksocietycrosscultural_castells_2004"><sup><a href="#ref-networksocietycrosscultural_castells_2004">2</a></sup></span></span></p>

<p><span class="power software platform">Castells developed his theory of the Network Society during the 1990's, a time when the <em>Internet Revolution</em> was seen through utopian visions and surrounded by great deal of optimism. While his account of the interplay between technological and social forces and his emphasis on networks as the primary form of social organization make up a useful frame through which to think about the ongoing changes that are taking place within contemporary societies, the emergence of global internet platforms since the turn of millennia unfortunately counters the narrative of decentralization and the flattening of vertically integrated powers. The corporations whose products and platforms are the main facilitators of the current information revolution constitute a new form of <em>social elite</em>, whose ideologies and software products are new <em>expressions of organized power</em>.</span></p>
<p><span class="power territory state network">Castells identifies two major ways power is exercised: violence (or the possibility of it) and persuasion, the transformation of people's minds. Power relations used to exist within easily identifiable territorial boundaries. These territorial boundaries were formed by nation-states through claiming the monopoly of violence within a given territory and propagation of nationalist sentiments within this territory. Nation, state and territory thus used to define the boundaries of a society.<span class="citation" data-cites="communicationpower_castells_2009"><sup><a href="#ref-communicationpower_castells_2009">3</a></sup></span> The accelerating process of globalization from the 1980s onwards has weakened the role of nation-states and the geographical boundedness of power. Although nation states did not disappear, today <em>&quot;the national boundaries of power relationships are just one of the dimensions in which power and counterpower operate.&quot;</em> Global economic and communication networks have transcended the geographical boundaries of nation states, and under these conditions the role of states have been reduced to that of nodes within these global networks.<span class="citation" data-cites="communicationpower_castells_2009"><sup><a href="#ref-communicationpower_castells_2009">3</a></sup></span></span></p>
<p><span class="cloud platform network power">Cloud platforms such as Google, Facebook, Apple or Microsoft are some of the newest materializations of this process. Castells names one of the most crucial forms of power in the network society: network-making power. He defines it as the <em>&quot;power to program specific networks according to the interests and values of the programmers, and the power to switch different networks following the strategic alliances between the dominant actors of various networks&quot;</em><span class="citation" data-cites="networktheorynetwork_castells_2011"><sup><a href="#ref-networktheorynetwork_castells_2011">4</a></sup></span> </span></p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p><span class="programming power network code">Programming and switching are terms borrowed from the field of computer science that he uses as metaphors to describe the constitution of power within a network. As such, their meanings are ambiguous. Programming simultaneously means the actual composition of computer code, but also legal code; the erection of policies that govern the mechanisms of the network. Switching borrows from the linguistic construct of the <em>switch statement</em> in programming languages<span class="citation" data-cites="switchstatement_2015"><sup><a href="#ref-switchstatement_2015">5</a></sup></span>. In programming it is used to control the flow of execution of a computer program, but in its social dimension, it denotes the ability to connect and to ensure the cooperation of different networks.</span></p>
<p><span class="code">What these terms hint at is that social processes have become tightly coupled with software processes: the construction of computer code conditions the construction of society and vice versa. The meaning of legal code and computer code collapse into one another.</span></p>
<p><span class="network power politics">A fitting example of this is Google. Its executive chairman Eric Schmidt embodies the essential characteristics of a switcher. He connects the information network of Google to the political network of the United States. In 2008, he was an informal advisor and major donor during Barack Obama's presidential campaign. When Obama was elected, Schmidt became a member of Obama's transition advisory board and later a member of the United States President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST).<span class="citation" data-cites="ericschmidt_2016-1"><sup><a href="#ref-ericschmidt_2016-1">6</a></sup></span> He is an interface between the corporate interests of Google and the political interests of the United States.</span></p>
<p><span class="programming politics network state power information">In terms of programming, the past conflicts between Google and China illustrate how values and interests manifested in the programming of a network can create points of friction with state power. The conflict was essentially a conflict of interests around the questions of freeness of information flow and censorship. It involved a Chinese cyber-attack on Google, to which Google responded by lifting its self-censorship. Years of battles entailed and in the process Google has lost almost all of its marketshare in China.<span class="citation" data-cites="googlechina_2016"><sup><a href="#ref-googlechina_2016">7</a></sup></span></span></p>

<h2>4.2 The Stack</h2>

<p>In a <a href="http://mthvn.tumblr.com/post/38098461078/thecloudthestateandthestack">discussion</a> about The Stack with <a href="http://mthvn.tumblr.com/post/38098461078/thecloudthestateandthestack">Metahaven</a> he says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Right now the geopolitics of the Cloud are defined by a clash between State and non-State organizations [...] with decentralized networks in between. In the coming years, the geopolitics of the Cloud will be defined by the tension and conversion of States and Clouds into one another: States becoming Cloud-based platforms, and Cloud-based platforms taking on more and more practical forms of sovereignty—identity, geography, mobility. So a Cloud Polis, we might imagine, would represent other weird kinds of “sovereign” software/State platforms that are probably not bound to specific spots of territory in the same way as the Westphalian nation-state was. They might be more effective and democratic, or more totalitarian, more or less elective than the models we have now.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="theory social-organization technology participation stack"><em>The Stack</em> is the totality of technologies, materials, human and non-human actors that in one way or another constitute part of what Bratton calls a planetary-scale computational megastructure. The Stack includes cloud platforms, servers, laptops, smart phones, ubiquitous sensors, the conflict minerals these are made of, smart energy grids and cities, ambient intelligence, interfaces, and their users. It is a computational layer that envelopes the crust of the earth. Instead of seeing these parts in isolation, Bratton proposes to view them as parts of an accidental megastructure, that layer by layer align themselves into a Stack. The theory of The Stack aims to fill a theoretical void concerning how the transformations driven by computing technology distort and reconfigure modes of political participation, citizenship and geography.</span> <span class="question">What sort of agency can we possess within the Cloud and how can we utilize it?</span></p>

<p><span class="legibility platform power cloud">There is an asymmetric relationship of legibility between Users and the Cloud. Consider the psychological experiment Facebook conducted on its users in 2012. Facebook deployed code that manipulated the emotional content of the news feed of users by either making the sentiment of the content more positive or negative. They found that people were more likely to express similar emotional states in their own posts to what they were exposed to. While setting aside the question of whether this experiments proves anything significant, it does demonstrate an unequal relationship of power, that is users are legible to the cloud, while the cloud is illegible to users.</span></p>

<img src="../imgs/interrogation.jpg" alt="" />
</figure>
<p><span class="power software platform">To further elaborate on this condition, let's take another company that epitomizes the practice of power through software: Uber. Uber is an online platform and mobile app through which customers in need of a ride are connected to drivers that use their own cars, i.e. informal taxi drivers. The Canadian film-maker Andrew Callaway conducted an experiment of serving Uber customers for a month in San Francisco and published an article <em>'Apploitation in a city of instaserfs'</em> to summarize his experiences.</span> He writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Realistically, people aren’t driving around strangers because they love it. They do it because they need to earn a living and it’s been hard in America since 2008. Workers are grateful for what they can get and here it’s the companies who have all the control. The standard ride-sharing or courier app’s business model looks something like this:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol type="1">
<li>When introducing your app into a new city, take heavy losses by over-paying drivers and under-charging customers.</li>
<li>Offer drivers cash bonuses to get their friends to sign up.</li>
<li>Once you’ve got a steady supply of drivers invested in the app, start lowering their pay.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The companies don’t send out an apologetic email letting drivers know a pay cut is on the way. It happens inconspicuously through “upgrades” to the app, which can often change fare and payment rates. Only drivers with enough extra time to carefully analyze their earnings will notice that the new terms don’t work in their favour. After enough pay cuts, some will quit, but many in the workforce buy cars specifically to become a part of the sharing economy and end up stuck, continuing to work for less money or switching to one of the other apps.<span class="citation" data-cites="apploitationcityinstaserfs_andrewcallaway_2016"><sup><a href="#ref-apploitationcityinstaserfs_andrewcallaway_2016">11</a></sup></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="code power">What becomes visible through these cases is a new form of social contract that structures conditions of everyday experience, labor, consumption and power. Lawrence Lessig has already outlined this condition in his essay <em>'Code is Law'</em> in 2000.<span class="citation" data-cites="codelaw_lessig_2000"><sup><a href="#ref-codelaw_lessig_2000">12</a></sup></span> At that time, the internet seemed like a space impossible to submit to any kind of regulation. It was commonly thought that by its very architecture it could guarantee liberty. That has turned out not to be true. Lessig foresaw what would unfold in the coming decades: if legal code is not implemented in computer code, computer code will displace legal code. If code would not implement governmental interests, it would implement private interests.</span></p>
<p><span class="cloud platform state software">This is where we are today. Cloud platforms are displacing state power. Their software constitutes the laws that set the conditions for and govern our social interactions and everyday experience. These laws are proprietary, developed in the private code repositories of cloud platforms. We are fully transparent to them, while they are fully opaque to us.</span></p>

</figure>
<p><span class="legibility design-practice technology stack">The Stack thickens. As more and more devices, sensors and artificial intelligence is deployed in the coming decades, it will become increasingly saturated and illegible. When we accept end-user-license-agreements we become part of the Stack, and we agree to the code that governs its logic, without being fully aware of its contents. Academics such as Bratton have taken on the role of symbolically dismantling the layers of the Stack in order make it more legible. The same challenge could also be articulated within the domain of graphic design. As I see it, graphic design's role is to render spaces legible - be it material space of or the space of ideas -, so that one can better situate oneself within these spaces and become more able to assert one's own life project.</span></p>
<figure>
<img src="../imgs/kinect.jpg" alt="" />
</figure>
<p><span class="stack interface">In fragments and in a reduced form, the Stack already makes itself visible to us through the layer that exists in-between us, its Users, and the rest of its parts. This layer is the graphical user interface and it is the layer that most readily lends itself as an object of designation to the discipline of graphic design.</span></p>
