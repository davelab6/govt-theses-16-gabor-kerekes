<h2>5.1 Translation of Voltage Differences</h2>
<p><span class="interface">An interface is a surface or a boundary at which two independent systems connect and interact. The term is used in biology for the common boundary between living beings and their environment (such as the skin), in chemistry for the boundary between two different phases of matter (such as an insoluble solid and a liquid), and in social science for the areas or points where two or more social groups connect.<span class="citation" data-cites="interface_2015"><sup><a href="#ref-interface_2015">1</a></sup></span> Most commonly though, the term is used in computing, referring to the boundary through which two separate components of a computer system exchange information. One such boundary is the graphical user interface (GUI), through which interactions between humans and machines occur, and which will be the focal point of this section.</span></p>
<p><span class="design-practice interface frame-of-representation">Today user interfaces are the main sites at which graphic design is produced. For this reason, I find it important to understand how these artifacts perform their functions and what effects these functions entail. Through the following text I would like to show that interfaces are not simply surfaces that make the use of computers convenient, but also ways of cultural framing that shape our practices and perceptions about the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="software">The world is increasingly permeated by software. It is in traffic-control systems, cashier desks, ATM kiosks, cars, trains, airplanes, microwaves, washing machines, medical equipment, fitness trackers, watches, cameras, phones, servers, personal computers. We are moving towards a time in which every square inch of the world will process and emit information and all of this will be facilitated by software.</span></p>
<p><span class="software">Despite its proliferation, the meaning of software is challenging to define. According to Wikipedia, it is <em>any set of instructions that directs a computer to perform specific operations.</em><span class="citation" data-cites="software_2016"><sup><a href="#ref-software_2016">2</a></sup></span> It is interesting to note that software is widely considered as being separate from hardware: an immaterial layer on top of it. Friedrich Kittler argued differently: &quot;there is no software&quot; because all computing operations ultimately come down to <em>signifiers of voltage differences</em><span class="citation" data-cites="therenosoftware_friedrichkittler_1992"><sup><a href="#ref-therenosoftware_friedrichkittler_1992">3</a></sup></span>.</span></p>
<p><span class="software hardware programming">Software can be likened to language: it can be thought of as a system of representing and manipulating symbols. It is the tool to represent the voltage differences mentioned by Kittler, that is: hardware operations. At the lowest level of representation there is a direct correspondence between software and the architecture of the hardware it controls. Such representations are written in low-level, so-called assembly languages, where constructs of the programming language directly denote specific actions of the underlying hardware. In the early days of computing, programs were written as direct instructions to the machine in assembly languages. Later, high-level programming languages were designed to abstract these operations. They allow the writing of human readable code that is automatically translated to machine code by the processes of compiling or interpretation. By separating instructions from the machine, they make hardware invisible, or rather, they translate its appearance into understandable forms.</span></p>
<p><span class="stack software hardware interface">Software is mounted on top of hardware as a stack. (Here I am not talking about Benjamin Bratton's Stack, although his theory is a particular interpretation of the same concept. Stacks are a recurring pattern of organization within computer science. see Wikipedia articles <em>Stack (abstract data type)</em><span class="citation" data-cites="stackabstractdata_2016"><sup><a href="#ref-stackabstractdata_2016">4</a></sup></span> or <em>Call stack</em><span class="citation" data-cites="callstack_2016"><sup><a href="#ref-callstack_2016">5</a></sup></span>). In-between the layers of the stack are interfaces that abstract the details of the underlying layer. The higher a piece of software is located within the stack, the higher the abstraction it provides from the machine. The highest level of abstraction is the graphical user interface.</span></p>
<p><span class="complexity legibility interface system">Through the example of a mouse-click fired upon a button within a web-interface, for a brief while I would like meditate on the complexity that is abstracted by the user interface. When a mouse button is clicked, the mechanical switch behind the button closes an electrical circuit. An electric signal is sent through a wire to the computer's <em>Universal Serial Bus (USB)</em><span class="citation" data-cites="usb_2016"><sup><a href="#ref-usb_2016">6</a></sup></span> outlet, which connects to the USB Controller on the computer's motherboard. The USB Controller generates a so-called <em>interrupt-request</em>,<span class="citation" data-cites="interrupt_2015"><sup><a href="#ref-interrupt_2015">7</a></sup></span> an alert to the processor to a high-priority condition that needs immediate processing. The processor suspends all its current activities, saves its state and executes a function called an <em>interrupt handler</em><span class="citation" data-cites="interrupthandler_2015"><sup><a href="#ref-interrupthandler_2015">8</a></sup></span>. The interrupt handler is part of the operating system. It reads the information associated with the mouse click event from the USB Controller into the computer's main memory, and puts it into the so called <em>event queue</em><span class="citation" data-cites="messagequeue_2015"><sup><a href="#ref-messagequeue_2015">9</a></sup></span> - a messaging-system used for the inter-communication of separate processes - of the operating system. Web-browsers, like most GUI applications employ a programming construct called the <em>event loop</em><span class="citation" data-cites="eventloop_2015"><sup><a href="#ref-eventloop_2015">10</a></sup></span>. The event loop runs every few milliseconds, over and over again while the application is open, processing incoming events from the operating system's event queue. The event loop dispatches each event to it's designated event handler implemented by the specific application. In the case of a web-browser, the event handler is a JavaScript (the scripting language used to build dynamic web-pages) function that was registered on the button the click was fired on. This final JavaScript function then executes the functionality attached to the button.</span></p>
<p><span class="interface legibility form software">Interfaces make computation legible. They distill the bewildering entanglement of components and instructions into a form that makes sense to the user, and through which one can engage in meaningful interactions with the software one uses. Buttons, windows, icons, browsers, clicking, surfing, e-mail, the cloud: these are all powerful metaphors that ultimately provide a meaningful face for the underlying binary data and operations our machines work with.</span></p>
<p><span class="interface politics hardware stack">The process of abstraction that interfaces perform is a process of rendition which entails a set of decisions about what to hide and what to reveal of the underlying complexity. Inasmuch as they are based on the designer's intentions to achieve a particular end, these decisions are politically charged. Most generally, this is the establishment of meaning in relation to hardware. The BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) abstracts details of the hardware, the operating system (OS) abstracts the BIOS, applications abstract the OS, and the graphic user interface abstract the application.<span class="citation" data-cites="therenosoftware_friedrichkittler_1992"><sup><a href="#ref-therenosoftware_friedrichkittler_1992">3</a></sup></span> Hardware itself is meaningless, it is the stack of software mounted on it that gives it purpose, making it able to perform functions we intend it to; and it are interfaces through which one's intentions are translated into functions of software.</span></p>
<figure>
<img src="../imgs/gui.jpg" alt="" />
</figure>
<p><span class="possibility-space interface form">However, through the abstraction of computing processes into familiar metaphors, interfaces also define the space of possibilities in which one's intentions can exist. They define what intentions are actually possible to hold, what processes one can or cannot initiate. By their design, interfaces give form to both ends that they connect: both to computation and to the user.</span></p>
<p>As Wendy Hui Kyong Chun argues,<br />
<em>&quot;Software, or perhaps more precisely operating systems, offer us an imaginary relationship to our hardware: they do not represent transistors but rather desktops and recycling bins. Software produces “users.” Without OS there would be no access to hardware; without OS no actions, no practices, and thus no user.&quot;</em><span class="citation" data-cites="softwarepersistencevisual_chun_2004"><sup><a href="#ref-softwarepersistencevisual_chun_2004">11</a></sup></span></p>
<p><span class="frame-of-representation interface">Interfaces define users and their relationships to the things they connect them to. By showing and hiding, by framing the system they are attached to in a specific way, they enable certain perceptions and actions while eliminating others. It is through this mechanism that the <em>like</em> button of Facebook transforms one's notion of value and the <em>profile</em> changes one's notions of identity and social relationships. Thereby, interfaces are not mere surfaces, mediating information and computing functions, but productive forces, or as Alexander Galloway puts it, <em>&quot;An interface is not a thing, an inter­face is always an effect. It is always a process or a translation.&quot;</em><span class="citation" data-cites="interfaceeffect_galloway_2012"><sup><a href="#ref-interfaceeffect_galloway_2012">12</a></sup></span></span></p>

<section id="in-graphic-design" class="level2">
<h2>5.2 In graphic design</h2>
<p><span class="tools software interface design-practice authorship">The introduction of personal computers and desktop publishing software with graphical user interfaces during the 1980's had far reaching consequences for the discipline of graphic design. Many forms of work that graphic design was dependent upon and which formerly required specialized skills could now be done on a PC. Authoring software freed graphic designers from having to rely on the work of production artists, photomechanical technicians, key-liners, paste-up artists, typesetters, color separators, and even some printers.<span class="citation" data-cites="toolpostproductiongraphic_blauvelt_2011"><sup><a href="#ref-toolpostproductiongraphic_blauvelt_2011">13</a>(p23)</sup></span> It did so by encoding the procedures involved in these crafts into computational processes, and remediating them through a user interface. Now that the user interface democratized the access to design tools and anyone with a computer and the right software packages could practice graphic design, the field was pressured to redefine itself to protect its relevance. A direct consequence of this is that increasingly, graphic designers defined themselves as authors. However, if production of design was now mediated by user interfaces, and if one recognized their productive effect on users', the notion of authorship would have to be reconsidered.</span> Lev Manovich argues that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;We can say that all authorship that uses electronic and computer tools is a collaboration between the author and these tools that make possible certain creative operations and certain ways of thinking while discouraging others. Of course humans have designed these tools, so it would be more precise to say that the author who uses electronic / software tools engages in dialog with the software designers.&quot;<span class="citation" data-cites="whoauthorsamplingremixingopen_manovich_2002"><sup><a href="#ref-whoauthorsamplingremixingopen_manovich_2002">14</a></sup></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="conclusion print interface design-practice authorship software"> Designers do not only produce through software, but - in a dialogical relationship with the engineers who created that software - they are also being produced by it. As digital media have become the dominant modes of communication, assimilating the function of printed matter into itself, graphic designers needs to go beyond the limitations of the user interface and embrace it as an object of design.</span></p>
<p><span class="programming tools design-practice">During the 80's and 90's this might have been too great of a leap for practitioners of a field that is primarily occupied with &quot;right-brain&quot;, creative work. High level programming and scripting languages such as Java, Python and JavaScript started to emerge during the 90's, but they were not particularly well suited yet for artistic and design purposes. Tools that would ease the learning curve and make efficient applications of these languages to the design process had not been developed until the 2000's.</span></p>
<p><span class="tools programming interface">One such tool, Processing was released in 2001. <em>Processing is a flexible software sketchbook and a language for learning how to code within the context of the visual arts.</em><span class="citation" data-cites="processingorg"><sup><a href="#ref-processingorg">15</a></sup></span> It was initiated by Casey Reas and Benjamin Fry at MIT Media Lab with the purposes of <em>promoting software literacy within the visual arts and visual literacy within technology.</em><span class="citation" data-cites="processingorg"><sup><a href="#ref-processingorg">15</a></sup></span> Processing is both a programming language and a development environment built in Java. Being a high-level language it greatly reduces the amount of knowledge and time needed to produce visual material by the means of code. It is one of the easiest entry points for visual artists and designers to go beyond the confines of the user interface. Although Processing has a GUI of its own - its integrated development environment (IDE)<span class="citation" data-cites="integrateddevelopmentenvironment_2015"><sup><a href="#ref-integrateddevelopmentenvironment_2015">16</a></sup></span>, it is not an interface attached to a set of predefined functionalities such as the case with Adobe authoring software, it is a tool to create new tools.</span></p>
<p><span class="tools information data">Learning tools such as Processing is of paramount importance in today's landscape of information as a significant proportion of cultural information can only be represented by developing custom software tools. In 2013, the Norwegian research organization SINTEF<span class="citation" data-cites="sintefno"><sup><a href="#ref-sintefno">17</a></sup></span> claimed that 90% of the world's data up until that point was generated over the course of the two preceding years.<span class="citation" data-cites="bigdatabetter"><sup><a href="#ref-bigdatabetter">18</a></sup></span> As the amount of data being produced is on an accelerating rise, this percentage must be even higher today. Most of this data is in a raw form, that is, it has not been subjected to any kind of processing. As such, it is meaningless.</span></p>
<p><span class="data artifact">The phenomenon of Big Data begs the question of whether generating so much data is actually solving any problems or whether it just blinds us to the fact that these problems might not have been articulated properly. Nevertheless much of the cultural artifacts that humanity produces today is in the form of data. With the methodologies of digital anthropology, stories can be excavated from this data and humanity can be rendered visible.</span></p>
<p><span class="interface practical-example">Graphic designer Richard Vijgen's practice is preoccupied with this exact challenge. He <em>&quot;investigate[s] new strategies to find the big stories in big data through research and design.</em>&quot;<span class="citation" data-cites="richardvijgen"><sup><a href="#ref-richardvijgen">19</a></sup></span> One of his projects, The Deleted City<span class="citation" data-cites="deletedcity20"><sup><a href="#ref-deletedcity20">20</a></sup></span> - written in Processing - is a fitting example of how graphic design can cross the threshold of the user interface and in fact, create one of its own in order to extract stories hidden in raw data. </span> <span class="data-visualization network platform practical-example interface"> The project is an interactive visualization of GeoCities, the first large-scale social network that emerged on the internet. GeoCities was a free web-hosting provider modeled after the concept of the 'city', where amateur internet enthusiasts could host their own <em>home-pages</em> and share information about themselves and the topics they were interested in. When in 1999 it was acquired by Yahoo! it was the third most visited website on the internet.<span class="citation" data-cites="yahoogeocities_2015"><sup><a href="#ref-yahoogeocities_2015">21</a></sup></span> Over the course of the 2000's, as other social networks such as MySpace and Facebook gained popularity, GeoCities had lost most of its users and in 2009, Yahoo! decided to shut the website down. At this point it contained at least 38 million user-built pages. A group of digital archivist, the Archive Team whose mission is to save valuable websites and data from being lost, created a complete backup of GeoCities, amounting to 650 gigabytes of data. Richard Vijgen's project is essentially an interface that allows one to browse this archive.</span></p>

</iframe>
<p><span class="data-visualization agency interface"> Although Richard Vijgen's project is a great example of how abstract data can be re-framed through custom software tools and thereby bringing audiences closer to a subject matter, data-visualization projects in certain cases might produce the opposite effect. In their conversation <em>Suspicious Images, Latent Interfaces</em><span class="citation" data-cites="suspiciousimageslatent_bratton_2008"><sup><a href="#ref-suspiciousimageslatent_bratton_2008">22</a></sup></span>, Benjamin Bratton and Natelie Jeremijenko critique environmental data-visualization projects on the ground that they spectacularize information, thereby distancing audiences from perceiving their own relationships and responsibilities in regards to pressing environmental issues. In their view, these data-visualization projects masquerade as interfaces, while in fact, they subvert the notion of the interface. <em>They imply there must be an expert - an expert system - somewhere making use of this information in a way that is somehow having some effect. (Bratton)</em> </span></p>
<p>Such projects however inspire important questions that can be asked in regards to interfaces, but which I think can also be directed to graphic design in general. In the words of Bratton:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="question" data-author="Benjamin Bratton">How can monitoring become the redesign of what it monitors? How does the image become an image-instrument?</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In an attempt to find answers to these questions, in the following chapter I will look at the medium of <em>process</em> and its potential to compose images into instruments.</p>
