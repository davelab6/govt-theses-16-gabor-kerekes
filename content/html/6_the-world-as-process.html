<h1>6. The World as Process</h1>
<p><span class="theory paradigm">Our Western philosophical tradition hinges on the fundamental assumption that reality is based on permanent substances whose dynamic features are taken as mere appearances.<span class="citation" data-cites="processphilosophy_seibt_2016"><sup><a href="#ref-processphilosophy_seibt_2016">1</a></sup></span> The change of an entity is only a superficial, derivative quality of that entity, while its essence is permanent. Its Being is primary, while its Becoming is secondary.</span></p>
<p><span class="theory machine determinism"> This assumption was firmly established by Aristotle and Plato who saw the world of change as merely the imprint of an eternal and unchanging reality of forms. Christian theology – to which our world view is still greatly indebted – incorporated this vision of reality and re-produced the concept of the eternal substance in the image of God. René Descartes conceived of the world as the assembly of physical and mental &quot;substances&quot; that exist independently and that endure unchanged through change.<span class="citation" data-cites="processrelationalphilosophyintroduction_mesle_2008"><sup><a href="#ref-processrelationalphilosophyintroduction_mesle_2008">2</a></sup></span> Descartes believed that the world could be explained mechanistically and that in order to understand complex phenomena one has to reduce them to their smallest possible components.<span class="citation" data-cites="newtonianworldview_f.heylighen_2006"><sup><a href="#ref-newtonianworldview_f.heylighen_2006">3</a></sup></span> This logic of reductionism later became the basis of the Newtonian world view that conceived of the universe as a fixed, predictable and deterministic machine, and in which human agency was non-existent.<span class="citation" data-cites="cartesiannewtonianparadigmp2p_2010"><sup><a href="#ref-cartesiannewtonianparadigmp2p_2010">4</a></sup></span> This particular reading of the world had largely conditioned the development of Western philosophy and science until the 20th century, but its remnants are still present in the way we place ourselves in relation to the world. Philosopher Alfred North Whitehead noted that <em>&quot;the safest general characterization of the European philosophical tradition is that it consists of a series of footnotes to Plato.&quot;</em><span class="citation" data-cites="processrealityessay_whitehead_1985"><sup><a href="#ref-processrealityessay_whitehead_1985">5</a></sup></span> </span></p>
<p><span class="procedure theory"> Whitehead belongs to a different paradigm of philosophical inquiry, called <em>process philosophy</em>. Process philosophers read the world as a constellation of interrelated processes, rather than of static entities. They prioritize Becoming over Being. In this reading, change is essential and Being is accidental. What holds importance is not so much <em>what there is</em>, but <em>what is occurring</em>. In contrast to the Newtonian world view it conceives of the world as an intricate web of dynamic relations, rather than mechanistically determined isolated objects. Process philosophy thus embodies a shift in perception from the <em>'The World as Text'</em> to <em>'The World as Process'</em>. </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This stance requires us to challenge and reject the prevailing philosophies and theologies that give primacy to Being over Becoming, to independence over relatedness, to things over processes, to the idea that the human spirit is fundamentally isolated from the social and natural web in which we clearly all live and move and are becoming.<span class="citation" data-cites="processrelationalphilosophyintroduction_mesle_2008"><sup><a href="#ref-processrelationalphilosophyintroduction_mesle_2008">2</a></sup></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is interesting to note that for most of its history the tradition of graphic design practice has revolved around the designation of artifacts that fostered an outlook similar to the one postulated by Aristotle and Plato. It prioritized Being over Becoming, independent objects over dynamic relations.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Modern design practice arose alongside the industrial revolution. Design has long been tied to manufacturing – to reproduction of objects in editions or “runs.” The cost of planning and preparation (the cost of design) was small compared to the cost of tooling, materials, manufacturing, and distribution. A mistake in design multiplied thousands of times in manufacturing is difficult and expensive to fix. The realities of manufacturing led to certain practices and in turn to a mindset or even a way of thinking. In the “modern” era, design practice adopted something of the point-of-view or even the philosophy of manufacturing — a mechanical-object ethos.<span class="citation" data-cites="designagebiology_hughdubberly_2008"><sup><a href="#ref-designagebiology_hughdubberly_2008">6</a></sup></span> – Hugh Dubberly</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="paradigm procedure model determinism print"> The prevailing paradigm of graphic design is rooted in the material base of printed matter. Print has fostered a specific model of the design process, in which the role of the designer is that of an expert who configures specific content within a physically bound artifact.<span class="citation" data-cites="graphicdesigntheory_davis_2012"><sup><a href="#ref-graphicdesigntheory_davis_2012">7</a></sup></span> Such a model also conditions the role of the audience as spectators. This model of design is analogous to the one put forth in the world-view of Descartes and Newton, where outcomes are pre-determined and meaning is fixed. I would like to add that this is not to be understood as some undesirable quality. There are many cases in which this quality is superior to dynamism. In my opinion, the &quot;slow medium&quot; of print facilitates a qualitatively different type of understanding than digital media, which could maybe be characterized as being deeper and longer lasting. </span></p>
<p><span class="print meaning determinism"> The claim however, that print would by definition mediate fixed meanings might be contrasted with the notion of 'The Death of the Author' put forward by Roland Barthes in 1967. The key idea of his argument is that meaning always comes to be in a relational capacity between a communicative work and its recipient. Meaning is plural; there is no Truth, but there are multiple truths.</span> He argued that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;a text consists of multiple writings, issuing from several cultures and entering into dialogue with each other, into parody, into contestation; but there is one place where this multiplicity is collected, united, and this place is not the author, as we have hitherto said it was, but the reader: the reader is the very space in which are inscribed, without any being lost, all the citations a writing consists of; the unity of a text is not in its origin, it is in its destination&quot;<span class="citation" data-cites="deathauthor_rolandbarthes_1967"><sup><a href="#ref-deathauthor_rolandbarthes_1967">8</a></sup></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="procedure meaning"> Any work of communication is always subject to the interpretation of the recipient of that work and this interpretation is always bound by the social and historical context the recipient is embedded in. The meaning of a work is unstable: many interpretations of it are possible and these interpretations change over time. Meaning thus is always a particular event in a wider <em>process</em>. </span></p>
<p><span class="design-practice meaning artifact"> While acknowledging the fact that the audience of a work is always free to interpret that work in any way they want, the traditional, object-centered definition of design practice does not lend itself very well to the expression of plural truths. The configuration of specific content within a fixed artifact is embedded in a linear model of communication, whereby the designer encodes his/her message and channels it to the receivers through the medium.<span class="citation" data-cites="modelscommunication_2015"><sup><a href="#ref-modelscommunication_2015">9</a></sup></span> This model of communication does not allow the receiver to take part in the creation of meaning, beyond the possibility of projecting his/her own interpretation on the artifact through which the message was transmitted. </span></p>
<p><span class="procedure machine artifact design-practice frame-of-representation complexity"> Today an increasing number of graphic designers take on the challenge of making claims about complex social and political issues. Taking side with process philosophy, I would like to argue that the mechanistic world view of the artifact-oriented graphic design practice is not particularly well-geared towards that challenge, and would like to propose that the discipline's existing oeuvre of representational frames should be extended with that of procedurality. </span></p>
<p><span class="procedure complexity rhetoric frame-of-representation"> Procedural representation enacts processes rather than merely describing them. By modeling real-world relationships, it is particularly well suited to argue about complex problems. It does not express fixed answers, but rather, its particular arguments are implicit in the way it models a system.<span class="citation" data-cites="persuasivegamesexpressive_bogost_2007"><sup><a href="#ref-persuasivegamesexpressive_bogost_2007">10</a></sup></span> </span></p>
<p><span class="procedure software authorship computation"> Procedures are themselves expressions of <em>&quot;set[s] of rules that precisely define a sequence of operations&quot;</em><span class="citation" data-cites="algorithm_2016"><sup><a href="#ref-algorithm_2016">11</a></sup></span>, otherwise called algorithms. Since computers' core function is to execute algorithms, they are the principal instruments through which procedures can be inscribed. Accordingly, the primary method of authoring procedures is achieved through writing software. </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Computation is representation, and procedurality in the computational sense is a means to produce that expression. [...] Because computers function procedurally, they are particularly adept at representing real or imagined systems that themselves function in some particular way — that is, that operate according to a set of processes. The computer magnifies the ability to create representations of processes. – Ian Bogost<span class="citation" data-cites="persuasivegamesexpressive_bogost_2007"><sup><a href="#ref-persuasivegamesexpressive_bogost_2007">10</a></sup></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="procedure paradigm authorship frame-of-representation possibility-space complexity"> Embracing procedurality as a paradigm of thought and as a mode of authorship implies a new conception of design practice. In this model, the role of designer shifts from <em>author</em> to <em>facilitator</em>, and in parallel it redefines the role of the audience from spectators to participants. Like other frames of representation, procedurality is predisposed to portray the world in ways that are specific to it. In a procedural frame, meaning is not pre-determined, but represented as a space of possibilities and is actualized by participants during their engagement in the procedure. It privileges Becoming over Being, and acknowledges reality as a web of interrelated processes. For the reason that procedurality captures the world in its process of Becoming, it makes a gesture towards the mutability of the world and implies the possibility of human agency. </span></p>
<p><span class="practical-example procedure data-visualization"> To see what this means in practice, consider Femke Herregraven's project, Taxodus<span class="citation" data-cites="taxodusmappingassets_femkeherregraven_2013"><sup><a href="#ref-taxodusmappingassets_femkeherregraven_2013">12</a></sup></span> as an example. Taxodus is an online game and data-visualization that models the ways multinational corporations evade the payment of taxes through various strategies. Players can choose to represent multinationals such as Apple, Amazon, Barclays or Coca-Cola and throughout the compressed simulation of a fiscal year they have to avoid as much tax on their behalf as they can. During the gameplay players are guided through the procedure of setting up subsidiaries and intermediate holdings in offshore tax havens. They get hints - based on real-world data of tax-treaties - on which geographical locations are the most optimal to neutralize tax burdens. At the end of the gameplay a fiscal report is generated and is automatically uploaded to a &quot;high-score&quot; database. </span></p>

<p><span class="agency legibility data-visualization procedure"> As discussed earlier, the world has to be rendered legible in order for us to understand and act upon it. We can only subject the world to the sphere of our influence as long as we have the means to read and to understand it. Taxodus facilitates this in two moves. Firstly, it opens up proprietary data that is is normally hidden from the gaze of the public and which only accountancy firms can afford to reach<span class="citation" data-cites="artistprofilefemke_lucychinen_2014"><sup><a href="#ref-artistprofilefemke_lucychinen_2014">13</a></sup></span>; it brings the unconscious into consciousness and makes it the subject of public discussion. Secondly, it chooses not to reduce its subject matter into mere diagrams, but to become the embodiment of the mechanisms it represents. Taxodus could have taken the format of a series of data-visualizations, but instead, it is presented in a format akin to its subject's original substance: procedurality. This move allows Taxodus to open up the possibility of engaging the public in the co-creation of its meaning and therefore it becomes an <em>image-instrument</em>. </span></p>
<p><span class="conclusion complexity frame-of-representation procedure"> As graphic designers we are faced with the challenge of having to represent and make claims about a world that is saturated with complex relationships to the point of opaqueness. The growing complexity of the techno-sphere, the mechanisms of climate change, or the inner workings of our financial markets are only a few examples of problems that can only be adequately addressed if we see them as procedures, rather than the summation of static entities and relationships. In order for us to meet this challenge, we need to renew our conception of the world. Instead of seeing it as a constellation of objects, we should see it as a constellation of processes. And as graphic designers, we can tap into the rhetoric power of procedurality in order to represent is as such. </span></p>
