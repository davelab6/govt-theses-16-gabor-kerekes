Abstract
--------

A new paradigm has started to emerge in the field of graphic design; a transformation of the set of techniques, values and methods that characterize its practice has been set in motion.

Traditionally, the practice of a graphic designer revolved around the formal arrangement of graphic elements into artifacts that mediated messages of commissioners. The three key aspects characterizing the profession have been 1) its position as a *service* within a *client/designer* relationship, 2) that it has been predominantly occupied with the *development of form*, and 3) that the products of the design process have been *specific artifacts*. In recent years, new models of practices have started to emerge within the field, seriously challenging these three aspects that once defined the role and identity of the graphic designer.

These advancements in the field of graphic design are occurring within the context of a larger social transformation - the growing decentralization of society, that is, the distribution of powers and functions from previously established centers. This change - to a large part - is driven by developments in technology. Since its large-scale adoption, the internet has decentralized  society in many aspects, but recent developments of the cryptocurrency bitcoin and its underlying mechanism, the block chain, can potentially extend the path of this development much further.

Instead of a text as a tree-like, hierarchical structure, a form that characterized the society which is being exceeded through today's technological revolutions, this thesis will take the form of a non-linearly arranged conceptual toolbox built out of nodes and edges, with which I intend to explore the connections between technology and decentralization and the implications for the field of graphic design. This thesis is intended to be browsed, rather than read.
