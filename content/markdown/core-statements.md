##Decentralization {.core-statement .decentralization}
It can be argued that the historical trajectory of the modern western world is that of a movement towards an increasingly decentralized society. Although this progression was not without regressions and relapses, in the long-run we have moved from the feudal society based on centralized power to modern democracies based on a more distributed power. That is not to say that centralized powers are absent from today's society [@networkglobalcorporate_vitali_2011], but overall, we do live in a more decentralized world.
