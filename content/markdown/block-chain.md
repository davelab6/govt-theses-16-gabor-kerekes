###Decentralization {.core-statement .decentralization}
It can be argued that the historical trajectory of the modern western world is that of a movement towards an increasingly decentralized society. Although this progression was not without regressions and relapses, in the long-run we have moved from the feudal society based on centralized power to modern democracies based on a more distributed power. That is not to say that centralized powers are absent from today's society [@networkglobalcorporate_vitali_2011], but overall, we do live in a more decentralized world. This process happened in leaps of technological and social development, that were set in motion by information revolutions.

#Block-chain
In October 2008, a person with the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto released a paper titled "*Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System*"[@bitcoinpeertopeerelectronic_nakamoto_2008] Combining existing peer-to-peer technologies, cryptographic techniques, he outlined a protocol for a decentralized cryptocurrency which he named Bitcoin. Bitcoin is based on a distributed database or ledger called the block chain.  Transactions on the block chain can be sent anonymously in a peer-to-peer fashion, without the use of intermediaries such as banks, funds or credit card and insurance companies. The identity of Nakamoto has not been yet uncovered, but his invention is continuing to gain widespread adoption.

The key innovation of the bitcoin protocol is the block chain, its public, shared ledger. This ledger is basically a distributed database containing all the transactions that have ever been made with the currency and is open to all nodes that participate in a network based on the bitcoin protocol.In practice, the ledger is maintained by special nodes called *miners* who collectively keep the ledger up to date. Miners validate transactions through a mechanism that involves solving a computationally expensive mathematical puzzle, and in return they receive newly generated bitcoins. The system is programmed in a way that only 21 million bitcoins can ever be mined; according to an estimate, all bitcoins will have been mined by the year 2140. Newly validated transactions form a block, which are then appended to the chain of previous blocks. Once a transaction has been added, it cannot be easily modified or deleted, since that would require the regeneration of all the blocks that came after it. The block chain is a ledger that anyone can add to, but no one can remove from. Another important characteristics of the block chain system is "*trustless trust*", meaning that participants do not need to know or trust each other in order to participate in the exchange of values; trust is effectively guaranteed by the block chain mechanism.

All of this might sound like a just geeky experiment, but bitcoin has actually been gaining momentum. The currency has gone through a number of speculative bubbles throughout its history, in fact its development follows the pattern of the archetypal bubble chart [@bitcoinmaybe_jessecolombo] created by scholar Dr. Jean-Paul Rodrigue. [@stagesbubble_dr.jean-paulrodrigue]. Although its history had its ups and downs, it's adoption is continuing to grow. During 2015 the number of companies trying out bitcoin has risen fourteen-fold. The number of bitcoin wallets, bitcoin-ATMs and merchants' annual revenue doubled. The sum of venture capital investments made in bitcoin has doubled. The number of venture capital backed start-ups has tripled. [@statebitcoinblockchain_coindesk] The amount of investment pouring into bitcoin is comparable to that of the early internet. [@bitlicenseimposeshigh_coindesk]

What are the driving forces behind bitcoin's adoption? It is no coincidence that the beginning of bitcoin coincided with the financial crisis of 2008. Bitcoin.org was registered in August 2008, and Nakamoto released his paper on a cryptography mailing list shortly after. [@futuresblockchain_noran.khan] When the first bitcoin block called the *'genesis-block'* was mined, Nakamoto included this line of text with the data: *“The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks.”*.[@bitcoinboom_bustillos_2013]

Besides providing the possibility of making peer-to-peer anonymized transactions without having to rely on banks and credit card companies that would charge transaction fees on them, bitcoin is also independent of state regulation. During the Cyprus financial crisis broke of 2013, the European Union together with the International Monetary Fund and the European Central Bank pushed President Nicos Anastasiades into going through with a plan which would have included the confiscation of money from every single bank account in Cyprus. Eventually, the plan was rejected by the parliament, but the drama had appeared to have caused a significant increase in the value of bitcoin.[@bitcoinboom_bustillos_2013] Indirect evidence suggested that Spaniards had taken interest in the currency - seeing the events in Cyprus as what could potentially happen to them next. Google searches from Spain for the term 'bitcoin' had spiked, as well as the number of downloads of bitcoin apps. [@jitteryspaniardsseek_bernhardwarner]

People's preference of an unstable and experimental currency over their banks  reveals the level of distrust in financial institutions that the financial crisis resulted in. In a world where much of the power is controlled by tightly knit network of corporations [@networkglobalcorporate_vitali_2011], there is a desperate need for the decentralization that bitcoin and the blockchain promise.
Will these technologies be used to that end?

As of yet bitcoin does not have a mechanism that would limit the accumulation of mining power. One of the most crucial points of the bitcoin protocol is decentralized consensus - that the miners that validate transactions are decentralized nodes in the system. This is what is supposed to guarantee the system's resistance to censorship and manipulation by a single entity. However, bitcoin doesn't have a way of proving that the miners who are at the center of the consensus mechanism are decentralized. In the early days of bitcoin, anybody could run mining software on their personal computers. As the number of miners grew, rising competition caused the appearance of specialized equipment and centralized structures of mining farm and pools.

Erosion of the original dream
The bitcoin might fail, but the block chain is too valuable of an innovation to disappear.

As the adoption of
However, Today, the barrier of entry is unreachable for most people; the only profitable way of mining bitcoins is by setting up mining farms of significant size,

The accumulation of mining power is posing a serious threat to the

Early in its carreer bitcoin became the currency of illegal marketplaces such as Silk Road.

The block chain could be the basis for a new economy in which producers - artists, designers, architects, writers could earn their living without intermedieries, such as curators, galleries and publishers.
